        <p>After plotting each city's latitude vs. its max temperature, there appears to be an obvious trend 
            showing the temperature dropping as the latitude grows larger (on the positive side). </p>
        <p>Though obvious, the data shows that the temperature for cities that are located north of the Tropic of Cancer (~23 degrees North latitude) is lower than the temperature in cities located between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer (0 to 23 degrees).</p>
        <p>The data also shows somewhat that the temperature does not drop drastically as the latitude grows larger (on the negative side), as it is currently sumer in 
                the Southern Hemisphere. Even for cities located at 40 degrees South latitude, the temperature is still sitting between 40 and 
                85 degrees F. </p>
