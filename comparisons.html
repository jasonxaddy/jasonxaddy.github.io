                    showing the temperature dropping as the latitude grows larger (on the positive side).</p>

            <p class="card-text">The graph above appears to show there is very little direct correlation between a city's latitude and its humidity levels. Interestingly, however, the graph shows that some locations near the North Pole were bone dry while others at the same latitude were drenched. The only trend that can be pulled from viewing this graph is that nearly all cities within the Tropics have at least 20 percent humidity, which goes along with common knowledge.</p>
